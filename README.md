Overview of the Leo Platform: https://docs.leoplatform.io

## Installation

### Pre-Requisites

1. Install the aws-cli toolkit - Instructions for this are found at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html
2. Configure the aws-cli tools - Instructions are found at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html
3. Install node - https://nodejs.org/en/
4. Deploy the [Leo Bus Cloudformation](https://github.com/LeoPlatform/Leo#step-2-install-the-leo-platform)

### Install

1. Install using npm.  In your project folder run the following command.

```
npm install leo-cli -g
```

## leo-cli create

### Create a System
A system provides you the opportunity to create a cohesive group of microservices. It is not required, but gives you a moment to consider the overall structure of your project. The `leo-cli create` commands will create a directory.

```
leo-cli create system MySystem
cd MySystem
```

### Create a Microservice

A microservice is the central architectural construct
```
leo-cli create microservice MyService
cd MyService
```

### Create a REST API

Microservice exposed via REST.
```
leo-cli create resource MyAPI
cd MyAPI
```

### Create a React Application

A front-end application. Also considered a microservice
```
leo-cli create react MyReactApp
cd MyReactApp
```
Additional tools for Leo front-end applications: 

[LEO Authentication](https://github.com/LeoPlatform/bus-ui/tree/master/ui/static/js) - Helps provide cognito authenticated api calls

[LEO Authorization](https://github.com/LeoPlatform/auth-sdk) - A Front-end Authorization framework that is modeled after AWS Permission structure

[Front End Specific Configuration](https://github.com/LeoPlatform/leo-config#ui-config) - Configure AWS Cognito for Front End apps

### Build Bots
Bots must be created inside a microservice directory

```
cd /MySystem/MyService
leo-cli create load MyLoadBot
leo-cli create enrich MyEnrichBot
leo-cli create offload MyOffloadBot
leo-cli create bot MyBot
leo-cli create cron MyCronBot
```

#### Testing Bots
Inside a bot directory

```
cd /MySystem/MyService/bots/MyBot
leo-cli test .
```

#### Runing Bots
Inside a bot or resource directory

```
cd /MySystem/MyService/bots/MyBot
leo-cli run .
```

## leo-cli publish - Publishing Microservices & Bots
Publishing a microservice will build all needed lambda functions into zip files and a cloudformation file.  Those files are then uploaded to your publish s3 bucket.

The publish command must be run from a micorservice or bot directory

```
leo-cli publish
```
##### Note:
As of version 2.0.0, leo_cli_config.js and leo_config.js are required to be able to publish.
See [leo-config](https://github.com/LeoPlatform/leo-config) for config details. Config files are automatically created as part of the Quick Start.

options
* **-e --env [environment]**        Environment.
* **--changeset**                   Only build Changeset.
* **-c**                            Only build cloudformation.
* **-s**                            Save cloudformation.json to the microservice directory.
* **-F --force-deploy**             Force-deploy without requiring confirmation of changeset.
* **-d --deploy [environment]**     Deploy the published cloudformation.
* **-f all --force all**            Force publish and deploy of all bots, including ones without changes.
* **--filter idGlobExp**            Filters the lambdas deployed by the given glob expression. default: *
* **--run awsStackName**            Runs the generated cloudformation.json against the AWS Stack 'awsStackName'.  If the stack doesn't exist, it will be crated

* **--public**                      Makes the s3 publish folder public

Version of the build using the microservice or bot package.json file.  If a bot is forced to be built and has the same version number the current timestamp will be appended to he version

Deploy Examples
---------------

Publish a Microservice with all new/updated bots

```
cd /MySystem/MyService
leo-cli publish 
```  


Publish a Microservice and force all bots to build

```
cd /MySystem/MyService
leo-cli publish --force all
```  


Publish a single bot in a Microservice

```
cd /MySystem/MyService/bots/MyBot
leo-cli publish
```  


Publish a single bot or resource in a Microservice

```
cd /MySystem/MyService/bots/MyBot
leo-cli publish 
```  

```
cd /MySystem/MyService
leo-cli publish --filter MyBot
```  


Deploying a Microservices to AWS
-------------------------------------

The deploy command can only be run after a microservice has been published.  You must be inside a microservice directory to deploy.

The second parameter is the name of the AWS Stack for the microservice.

```
cd /MySystem/MyService
leo-cli deploy . TestMyService
leo-cli deploy . StageMyService
leo-cli deploy . ProdMyService
